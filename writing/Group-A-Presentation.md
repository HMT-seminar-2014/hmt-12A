## The exterior scholion on 154v ##
!{Exterior scholion}[extscholion] 

- very long
- difficult to read in many places (size, fading, hand)
- has a !{leaf at the end}[leaf]
- discusses one word, "ἔμπεδον" "in the ground, firm set" extensively

## Passage in question ##

Il. 12.9-12: 
       τὸ καὶ οὔ τι πολὺν χρόνον ἔμπεδον ῆεν·
ὄφρα μὲν Ἕκτωρ ζωὸς ἔην καὶ μήνι᾽ Ἀχιλλεὺς.
καὶ Πριάμοιο ἄνακτος ἀπόρθητος πόλις ἔπλε.
τόφρα δὲ καὶ μέγα τεῖχος Ἀχαιῶν ἔμπεδον ῆεν·

And it was not for a very long time "ἔμπεδον"
As long as Hector was living and Achilles continued to rage
and the city of the ruler Priam was unsacked,
so long the great wall of the Achaeans would be "ἔμπεδον"

---

## Unusual length ##

- one of very few long exterior scholia (cf !{12v}[12v]) 

---

## The problem with ἔμπεδον ##

- "ἔμπεδος" means "firmly set." 
- "ἔμπεδος" can be broken up into "ἐν" (in/on) + "πέδον" (ground, plain)
- The Trojans are able to break the wall down, therefore it cannot truly be "firmly set" as long as Troy remains unsacked.
- Thus, the scholion argues that "ἔμπεδον" should be taken as "on the plain".

---

## Interlinear glosses ##

- Over the first occurrence of !{"ἔμπεδον,"}[intl1] 
- Over the !{second}[intl2] 



---

## Source of argument ##

- This same argument appears in other manuscripts
- This originally comes from Porphyry's *Homeric Questions*
- Manuscript Escorialensis Ω 1.12 !{folio 104 recto}[esc104r] 
and !{verso}[esc104v]
we know to come from Porphyry.
- Explicit statement !{"of Porphyry"}[porphyry]

---

## Other interesting note ##

Scholion in Ω 1.12 spans two pages, despite discussing one topic.

---

## Conclusion ##

- The content of this scholion must be important 
- These findings raise questions about exterior scholia in general
