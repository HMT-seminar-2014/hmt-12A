-discusses one word, "ἔμπεδον" "in the ground, firm set" extensively 

Il. 12.10-12: 
ὄφρα μὲν Ἕκτωρ ζωὸς ἔην καὶ μήνι᾽ Ἀχιλλεὺς.
καὶ Πριάμοιο ἄνακτος ἀπόρθητος πόλις ἔπλε.
τόφρα δὲ καὶ μέγα τεῖχος Ἀχαιῶν ἔμπεδον ῆεν·

As long as Hektor was living and Achilles continued to rage
and the city of the ruler Priam was unsacked
so long the great wall of the Achaeans would be "ἔμπεδον"

-"ἔμπεδον" means "firmly set." However, this scholion argues that rather than "firmly set," it should be understood to mean "on the plain." This is because the wall cannot truly be "firmly set" if the Trojans are able to knock it down.

- Comparing this with other manuscripts, it seems that this comes from Porphyry. Manuscript Escorialensis Ω 1.12 folio 104 rector and verso we know to come from Porphyry. urn:cite:hmt:e4img.e4_446 urn:cite:hmt:e4img.e4_137
